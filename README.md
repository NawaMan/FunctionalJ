# FunctionalJ

This repository is where I put things I play around about Functional Programming in Java.
Although, there are some code I actually use but most are just experimental.

You may find the following interesting:

- FunctionaJ.withIndex -- Stream with index.
- FunctionaJ.cache -- quick way to make a cahce.
