+ Create ObjectLensWithSub
+ Create an interface for each custom Object that has Lens in its type
+ MapAccess
+ MapLens
+ NullableLens
+ OptionalAccess and OptionalLens
+ Make Nullable and Optional lens transparents (don't see it as object)
/ Annotate the getter to be null sensitive (Null unsafe) -- no-need.
+ Generator for list
+ Generator for map
+ Generator for MayBe
+ Generator for Nullable
+ Generator for Optional
- Date, LocalDate, LocalTime
+ withList should have arvs
- In/Pluk - Select input an object and accept a function (maybe only predicate)

+ Tuples
+ Tuples to function params

+ Failable
- Pipe
+ FunctionalList
+ FMap
- Promise
- Prism -> Multiple Promise combine to one. create an obj from supplier/function of each fields.
- StoreRef, StoreList, StoreMap

- Clean up TYPE,VALUE,DATA

+ TupleLens
- List lens should has similar interface as FunctionalListLens
+ StreamPlus
- Builder
- ExhaughBuilder
- MapBasedDataObject
- Remove MayBe? -- let's keep it ... using _ prefix
- Remove Kinds? -- let's keep it ... using _ prefix
- List each
- remove the compose package.

+ Spead (duplicate) or,orGet join to every corner of the Access world.

Need to organize this and prioritize!!!

- Find a way to specify what lens for a type.
- Origin of functions and lambda
- Serialization
- Organize predefine functions
- Reflection 
- 
- Transvable of DataObject

- Combine validation

- map -> then
- flatMap -> chain
