# Pipeable and PipeLine

## `Pipeable`
`Pipeable` allows (to a level) us to write fluent like code even if the functions are not the method of the data.


## `Pipeline`
`PipeLine` lets us pre-compose functions into a flow without the input.
For those familiar with functional program, it allow point-free style code.

I will write more of this -- promise.
